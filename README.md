Hello fellow rubyists!

This repo contains 3 possible exercises to do at a hackathon.

## Labs

Here are the labs.

### 1. (Codelab) Gemini to acccelerate TDD development

* https://codelabs.developers.google.com/tdd-ruby-app-duetai
* This codelab will help you use Gemini code assist to help you code a [TDD](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development)
  [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) App.

### 2. (skillsboost) [Using Ruby on Rails with Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL on Cloud Run](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/20047?parent=catalog)

In this lab, you'll use cloud Skillsboost to set up resources and be guided through.

* **Lab**: https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/20047?parent=catalog
* **Credits**: built-in.

_Fun fact: Skillsboost backend leverages Ruby code to check for your implementation!_

### 3.  Build an AI agent in 15 min Langchain.rb

* Lab: under folder `03-codelab-build-ai-agent-in-15m-with-langchainrb-and-gemini/`.
* Credit: onramp or UAPaaS.

## Credits

Credits will be given to you by the organizer using a number of different credit systems:

* `Onramp`. This is a custom/private application which allows you to have a Billing Account with some money attached to your personal account (eg a GMail identity). This has limited billing access but the bill is assigned to you (and wil expire in ~3 months). All infra that you build will remain and belongs to you.
* `UAPaaS`: User and Password as a Service. A proctor will give you an identity (user/pass) complete with Billing attached. Everything you build with it will be destroyed, and credentials revoked, after a few days from the end of the event.

One is native to Cloud Skillsboost and the other two are provided by Googlers.
